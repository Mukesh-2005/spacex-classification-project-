# 🚀 SpaceX Falcon 9 Classification Project

This repository documents my hands-on labs from the Coursera Data Science Capstone, focused on classifying SpaceX Falcon 9 launch outcomes. Each folder represents a modular lab session, covering the full data science pipeline — from data collection to dashboard deployment.

## 📚 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 launches using historical data. I explored multiple stages of the workflow including API calls, web scraping, SQL-based EDA, geospatial mapping, and supervised machine learning.

## 🧪 Lab Breakdown
| Lab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| [**1. Data Collection**](1_Data_Collection/) | Collected Falcon 9 launch data using REST API calls, extracting relevant features for analysis |
| [**2. Web Scraping**](2_Data_Webscraping/) | Parsed HTML tables to extract structured launch data using BeautifulSoup |
| [**3. Data Wrangling**](3_Data_Wrangling/) | Cleaned and transformed the dataset, handled missing values, engineered features, and labeled outcomes |
| [**4. EDA (SQL)**](4_EDA_SQL/) | Queried launch data using SQL syntax in Jupyter to validate insights |
| [**5. EDA (Visualization)**](5_EDA_Visualization/) | Explored relationships using statistical plots and prepared features for modeling |
| [**6. Location Analysis**](6_Location_Analysis_with_Folium/) | Mapped launch sites using Folium and calculated distances to key geographic features |
| [**7. Dashboarding**](7_Python_Dashboard/) | Built an interactive Dash app with dropdowns, sliders, and dynamic charts |
| [**8. Model Evaluation**](8_Model_Prediction/) | Trained and compared Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN classifiers on launch data |
